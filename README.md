# Impact-of-Water-Quality-on-Chickpeas
This repository contains all research materials and data related to the study on the impact of water quality on the growth of chickpea plants (Cicer arietinum). The project examines how different types of water filtered, industrial, domestic, and marble industry water affect various growth parameters such as germination rate, shoot and root length, and biomass (fresh and dry weight) of chickpeas.

Included are dataset and statistical analysis script. The purpose of this project is to provide insights into how water quality influences chickpea growth and to inform agricultural practices and water management strategies for sustainable chickpea cultivation.
